 *
 *      Code for limit switches and emergency stop. The limit switches, physical emergency stop
 *      button, and an optoisolator used as a GPIO-driven switch are wired in series as normally closed.
 *      The GPIO-driven optoisolator acts as a en emergency stop triggerable from software.
 *      3.3 V is applied on one end of the chain, and the other output is used as the "set" input to a latching circuit
 *      made up of two NAND gates. When any switch in the series is interrupted, even momentarily, the outputs of the
 *      latch toggle, and  maintain their state until the reset input is pulsed from high to low to high. The output of the
 *      latch goes directly to the enable outputs of the arm drive motors and the Z stepper motor, so they are immediately
 *               stopped.
 *      The output also triggers a software interrupt that sets a global gSTOP variable, so that all movement commands will
 *      stop executing and return. The stopped signal from the latch is reset by a GPIO output from the microcontroller,
 *      that is, it can only be reset from software.
