 *
 *      Facilitates interaction with a host system, using binary data over the serial port.
 *      The micro-controller and the host system must use the same codes for commands, and
 *      use the same data types, all programmed in advance.
 *      Commands sent to the micro-controller are represented as an array of structures
 *      containing a function pointer and the number of characters of data the function
 *      receives as input over the serial port. The command's position in the array (as an unsigned byte)
 *      is the first character (sometimes the only) byte that is sent as part of a command. Every
 *      command thus receives at least one byte of input. The subsequent bytes are arguments, whose
 *      number and type vary according the function. The interpreter calls the numbered function with
 *      a buffer containing the received characters. The function parses the arguments, runs the command, and
 *      places results (if any) in a results buffer. If results are returned, the first byte in the buffer
 *      must be the number of bytes that were placed in the buffer (including the first byte, which is not
 *      sent, being used by the interpreter). If the function has results to send back to the host, a non-zero
 *      value is returned, else 0 is returned and no return data is transmitted. This gives the host the option
 *      of sending commands without having to wait for a return value from some length process.
